          A spirit of fire has taken the form of this giant dragon. Making its
          home in the Eldin region, it's said to have served the Spring of Power
          since ancient times. An old saying goes, \"The dragon ascends to the
          heavens as the sun begins to set,\" but nobody has witnessed this in
          the current age. The flames that coat its body make it dangerous to
          get near, but Dinraal bears no ill will toward people.
